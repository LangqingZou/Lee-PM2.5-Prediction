The train set is the data for the first 20 days of each month, and the test set is a sample of the remaining data from the Fengyuan District, Taiwan, China.<br>
**train.csv**: 12 months of meteorological data for each hour of the first 20 days of each month (18 features per hour) <br>
**test.csv**: The remaining data are sampled for 10 consecutive hours, the first nine hours of all observations are treated as features, and the tenth hour of PM2.5 is treated as answers. 240 non-repeated test data are taken, and the PM2.5 of these 240 data are predicted according to the linear model I created.<br>
